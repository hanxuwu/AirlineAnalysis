Unfriendly staff, Boarded half the plane when they realised there was a mechanical problem with the plane, a mechanical problem 20 minutes before it was supposed to take off, they worked on the problem for 2 hours which makes it seem I was a bit more serious than a small error. Would never fly again."
Boeing 737,Couple Leisure,Melbourne to Adelaide,July 2019,2,1,2,2,no,"""staff seem to be ill trained""",Sal Provino,"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Adelaide. My wife and I recently flew TigerAir to Melbourne and on the way back home this airline had a staff member with portable scales weigh cabin bags of every single passenger lined up to board the plane. I was 1.4kg over (I had a bottle of water in my bag) and I was ordered to march over to the service desk and pay $36.45 for the extra weight. An expensive exercise for a few extra grams! We were terribly disappointed because we had prepaid for up to 25kg on the one luggage bag we checked in earlier, but it only weighed 19kg at the check in. If provision had been made to us to weigh our carry on bags at the check in, we would have had 6kg extra. Instead, we received a heavy penalty. This is pathetic and TigerAir ought to hang its head in shame for such unnecessary revenue raising tactics, lack of integrity and treating customers with little or no authenticity. If you are that poor, then please raise your prices, improve your level of Customer Service, which is currently extremely lacking to say the least, and needs a transfusuion of some sort. Stop treating people flying in your planes as illegal refugees! Your staff seem to be ill trained. I truly wish I had more positive comments to make - but I’m afraid this Tiger has no teeth. Good luck for the 'future'."
,Couple Leisure,Brisbane to Darwin,July 2019,,,1,1,no,"""We arrived three minutes late""",Stephanie Bandy,✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Darwin. Absolutely horrible. Customer service at the desk was horrendous. We arrived three minutes late for a bag drop & had checked in online hours previously. No signage anywhere saying that the flight had been closed. Every other airline has a drop off time of 30 mins except Tiger. Never ever flying with them again.

My 86 year old mother flew Tigerair this week and the airport staff could not have been more helpful assisting her to get through the check-in process, arranging an aisle seat at the front of the plane and then a lift to get on the plane, thus avoiding all the stairs. Thank you, Tigerair."
,Business,Brisbane to Sydney,July 2019,,,1,1,no,"""no respect to their customers""",R Marlen,"✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Sydney. I made a booking with Tigerair a week prior for a 7:10am flight to Sydney and a return with jetstar for 2pm as I had an appointment in the morning. The morning of the flight at 6:01am (1hr 9mins before the flight) I receive a call as I'm walking into the airport that the Tigerair flight has been canceled. But don't worry because we booked you another flight at 11:05am with virgin. My appointment was at 10:45am making the whole re-book pointless as I explained to the call center guy who is based in China by the way, but they proceeded to book it and say because we booked you another flight 5 mins before the end of the 4hr after flight time window we don't owe you a refund! 5mins. What about the 69min cancellation heads up? they expect you to check-in 2hrs before the flight! And to be at the gate 45mins before takeoff! So now I'm lost for the day, missed my appointment and out of pocket $205. Pathetic. Garbage airline. No sympathy. And most of all no respect to their customers. "

Finally after waiting for more than 3 hrs boarded at 12:15 pm. Wait best part is here: At 12:30 noon pilot announced that we are waiting on a pilot to arrive and will be in 15 mins.

,Solo Leisure,Sydney to Melbourne,July 2019,1,1,1,1,no,"""delays and lost luggage""",Beverley Griffiths,"Not Verified |  Sydney to Melbourne. Flight delays and lost luggage were the beginning of my weekend away with Tigerair. No customer service operator to assist and finally a one hour flight has taken 5 1/2 hours of the week end. The return flight home was even worse with 5 cancellations to the flight, an overnight stay at the airport hotel, rude customer service, no compensation or complimentary tokens for the 18 hour delay! A never to be repeated experience! Totally terrible Tigerair!"

I don't take too often flight and I don't know than I have to check in before going to the gate so I miss my flight and I've been charged $85 extra fee. The staff was very unpleasant and unhelpful. I will never take again a flight with Tigerair.
,Solo Leisure,Adelaide to Brisbane,July 2019,1,2,1,1,no,"""Absolutely junk!""",A Allen,"✅ Trip Verified | Adelaide to Brisbane with Tigerair Australia. Absolutely junk! The flight was delayed 2 hours from the scheduled time. The staff on the ground were absolutely unapproachable. The seats have no knee room at all, attached together. The return flight, on the way to Adelaide I was late by just one minute for checking due to the queues of passengers lined up. By the time I got to one of the rude staff members it was 10 minutes late so I had to pay an extra $85 to get on the next flight."

H Matthew","Not Verified |  Coolangatta (OOL) to Melbourne (MEL). What can you expect from Tigerair? They are known as the 'cheap' airline of Australia. Normally large families fly on this airline. I managed to get cheap tickets during a sale. I flew Tigerair to Melbourne and Jetstar back. The flight was delayed by more than an hour and the cabin had not been cleaned. There was rubbish from the previous passengers. After waiting in line for half an hour, we finally saw the plane touching down. It taxied around and then mate it to the gate. We started walking across the tarmac and the previous passengers we still getting off. The plane's interior is tight and looks bad. The seats are basically square and are very uncomfortable. The flight was only around 2 hours so it wasn't that bad. On flights, Tigerair does not provide any refreshments or meals. You can purchase them but they are pretty pricey. Tigerair does provide in-flight entertainment for a small amount. You have to download the Tigerair app before boarding the plane. Then you purchase the internet on the plane. Most people don't use the app because of 3 reasons. The internet is expensive, No one knew about the app before boarding and it is a short flight."
,Solo Leisure,Coffs Harbour to Sydney,July 2019,,,1,2,no,"""Absolutely disgusted""",Jason Darcy,Not Verified |  Coffs Harbour to Sydney. Absolutely disgusted. 5 min late due to a taxi running late. Arrived at 11.05 plane left 11.50am. Still hadn't arrived from Sydney. Had no bags to check and would not let me on as 5 min late. Staff were rude and when contacted support service got told to send email. Never again.

After reading the reviews on here I was worried about my flight, but from the moment we arrived at Brisbane Domestic Terminal till we left Terminal 4 at Melbourne we had no problems. The ground staff were very helpful and the flight attendants were cheerful courteous and looked after us. I would not hesitate to book with this airline again!"
,Solo Leisure,Melbourne to Adelaide,July 2019,2,3,1,2,no,"""poor customer service""",Sam Evans,✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Adelaide. Incredibly poor customer service at Melbourne Tullamarine at 8:40am on Sunday 7 July. The worst I have ever experienced. I will not use this airline ever again.
,Business,Sydney to Brisbane,June 2019,2,4,1,3,no,"""appalling customer service""",Remi Piet,"Not Verified |  Sydney to Brisbane. I have been very negatively surprised by the appalling customer service I had on my recent Tigerair flight. Gate agents  decided to charge me a luggage fee ""because I was on an exit row"" and more importantly were very unprofessional on addressing the issue. When I brought up the issue to customer care, the comment I receive was a clear attempt at covering up an error: ""I can confirm on the day it was identified at the boarding gate that you cabin baggage did not meet the size or weight requirements as outlined in our terms and condition. To allow your baggage to travel with you on TT358 you have been charged correctly."" The above is  false and a lie. "
,Business,Sydney to Melbourne,June 2019,1,1,1,1,no,"""a pathetic airline""",C Jeremy,❎ Not Verified | Sydney to Melbourne. What a pathetic airline. Cancelled A flight due to alleged bad weather despite it being clear and sunny from departure to destination. There were clearly other factors at play they chose not to disclose - it's poor treatment to offer an alternative flight an hour earlier on a Friday afternoon knowing full well people cannot make it from work in time. 100% worst airline ever. Never again.
,Solo Leisure,Sydney to Melbourne,June 2019,1,2,1,1,no,"""an unreliable airline""",Laura Castro,"✅ Trip Verified | Worst service ever! Tigerair's flights are never on time, I had my flight from Sydney to Melbourne and the flight was delayed by 30 min and then it departed 10 min from the already modified departure time. This is an unreliable airline, go with JetStar."
,Business,Brisbane to Melbourne,June 2019,1,1,1,1,no,"""over 7kg cabin baggage""",Gurtej Chahal,Not Verified |  Brisbane to Melbourne. I will give negative stars if I have any option. Charged $46 for 0.78 over 7kg cabin baggage. Politely asked of just going over but when the only intent is to charge $46 for anything over 7kilos then you cannot argue your point at all. 
,Family Leisure,Sydney to Brisbane,June 2019,,,1,1,no,"""Just plain bad service""",K Sheikh,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Brisbane. Just plain bad service, as other reviewers have mentioned they will cancel flights on you if there's not enough passengers. We were supposed to fly Sydney to Brisbane on flight 358 at 09:15am but at 5:40am we received an email the flight has been cancelled, my wife called their customer service right away to see what our options were, and was told there must have been some issue because the flight is still there. We get to the airport at 07:10am only to be told that the flight was indeed cancelled. The only option was to fly out on Virgin Australia at 12:00pm, now on my daughter's birthday we're spending the time at the airport. We weren't given any options to change the flight either, even though Virgin had flights at 9:45am, 10:00am, and 11:00am but they wouldn't touch our tickets with a ten foot pole saying these are tickets booked on TigerAir and this is the ONLY option available to you, unless you buy a 300 dollar ticket for each of the persons. In conclusion, don't book TigerAir, just spend a bit more money up in advance and book a decent airline like VirginAir, or Qantas, stay away from this shoddy airline."
,Solo Leisure,Sydney to Melbourne,June 2019,1,1,1,1,no,"""ruined my trip""",Omar Salem,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Melbourne. Rude steward on flight TT 269 SYD to MEL and poor website design. After getting my eboarding pass scanned and while getting into the aircraft, my phone went to sleep mode and the page refreshed, so could not show my seat, the steward said in an aggressive way ""you need to find it!"" opened the link that was sms'd to my phone (which was supposed to be my boarding pass) instead redirected me to bookings where I had to enter my 6 digits booking reference, which I obviously could not remember off the top of my head. all this took place at the aircraft door, very frustrating and ruined my trip. Never again."
,Solo Leisure,Sydney to Perth,June 2019,1,1,2,1,no,"""one of my worst flight""",L Caneitas,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Sydney to Perth and 30mins before landing the Captain announced that we couldn’t land in Perth due to weather conditions and that we actually headed back and were about to land in Adelaide ! (I just don’t get why all the other companies were able to land) A 5 hour flight turned into almost 8h, and the next flight is like 16 hours later! They refused to give any compensation ; it was enough for them to just give us another ticket and a night at the hotel but what about all the trip and hotel I booked in Perth ?  I just ended up booking another flight with Virgin. Not serious, this company is the biggest joke I’ve ever seen. Plus, the comfort aboard is 0. No space at all, one of my worst flight."
,Family Leisure,Cairns to Brisbane,July 2018,2,1,1,1,no,"""frustrated and annoyed""",M Madallah,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cairns to Brisbane. This is really frustrated and annoyed to travel with Tigerair. first time i have been informed my flight has been delayed 8 hrs (due to some technical fault) and landing at Brisbane airport 2.30am ,where I dont have car rental open, no availability of late hours accommodation so I had to changed all my plan,s push one day a head which required extra cost and time just because of flight delayed. Again next consecutive day I got a message from Tigerair, my flight has been delayed again 5 hrs (due to some technical fault). Airline only offered refund price, and when i asked about all the associated cost which relate to this flight delayed then it was mentioned, you can claim this on customer portal site but it is not guarantee. "
,Solo Leisure,Cairns to Sydney,June 2019,3,1,1,2,no,"""policies and  pricing, could use a rework""",Kara Spellman,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cairns to Sydney. I have flown in and out of cairns in the last week through tigerair. Both flights I’ve been disappointed in the service. On my way here I offered the woman next to me my window seat. Because of this, the staff came back and forth to us three times asking for our names, our boarding passes, and our ids. They said it was for safety purposes which is fine,  but the demeanor and lack of kindness was over all unsettling. The woman and I laughed it off because we both understood staff was doing their job. However, throughout the entire flight I don’t think I got one smile out of any of the staff. Fast forward to my flight today. I’m not from Australia so my card often gets declined. When I went to pay for my baggage (which if you’ve never flown with this airline they charge 90 dollars extra to check a bag) my card didn’t go through. No big deal, also not the staffs fault. But when I was met with the supervisor she asked me how long I was going to be here and how I planned on supporting myself. Which in my opinion, seems a little personal. All in all I understand customer service, I’ve worked in the customer service industry for a very long time, and your staff, your policies, and your pricing, could use a rework."
,Solo Leisure,Sydney to Brisbane,June 2019,3,3,1,2,no,"""check-in has already closed""",S Junay,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Brisbane. I had flight departing at 6:45am, I reached the airport at 6:15 am so as I tried to check-in one of the staff said the check-in has already closed, which was half an hour prior to the departing time. So they made me get the ticket to next available flight paying $85 extra which was 2 and half hour later. Wsn't a very good experience at all."
,Solo Leisure,Brisbane to Melbourne,June 2019,3,3,1,1,no,"""over the baggage allowance""",Arani Kuhanesan,Not Verified |  Brisbane to Melbourne. The service was absolutely unacceptable. Individuals travelling in this airlines are made to feel as though they have done something wrong being over the baggage allowance. I was over by 0.86kg and was expected to pay $46 and I had to throw a pair of shoes in the bin. I will never travel with them again.
,Solo Leisure,Melbourne to Sydney,June 2019,,,1,1,no,"""said they closed check in""",A Marhan,✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Sydney. Could hear them calling for last call for Sydney. I went up to the counter and they said I should check in the kiosk. When I went to the kiosk it said the checkin was closed. Went back to the counter and they said they closed check in. Didn't let me board their last flight and charged me 85 dollars to board the next flight at 6am in the morning. Horrible customer service.

Our flight supposed to depart on 7:10am and we have received a text from Tigerair around 5:30am advising us the flight was cancelled and we have to move to the next flight.

I should learn time and time again to not fly with this joke of an airline but alas here we are again! Every single time I fly with them about 10x in the last 2 years the flight has been delayed. Never has it ever been on time. My birthday was totally ruined in April a long weekend in Perth ended up being about a day in Perth, lost money on car, hotels everything because they outright cancelled the flight and rebooked another 6 hours later. Compensation? whats that? My flight today is not until 6.30pm tonight and already at 12pm its been delayed so no doubt that will be much later than anticipated. Seriously what is the issue with this airline? the flights are not even that cheap!"
,Couple Leisure,Perth to Melbourne,May 2019,3,4,5,4,yes,"""Staff at Perth airport fantastic""",S Bradford,"Not Verified |  I have never left a review unless awful or excellent. Staff at Perth airport were fantastic. My spouse and I were not seated together as we booked through separate platforms. The lovely ground crew at Perth airport tonight gave us seats and after check in closed, paged us to update our tickets so we could sit together. (There were no spare seats until check in close and someone didnt check in). Absolutely lovely, cheerful, nice, informative! 10/10. Now we will wait until Melbourne, fingers crossed for the same though I don't hold my breath (Canberra are notoriously terrible)."

The lady at the service desk said my ticket was upgraded. I got no other service as part of the upgrade. I will never recommend it to anyone."

My flight was at 6:45 am, was told at 6.40 am that the flight has been cancelled and not reason given. The ground staff did not know why it’s cancelled at how the passengers should travel. It was absolute chaos. Later on I checked the same flight 6:45 am from Mel to Sydney was cancelled thrice in a row. At 7.30 am, there was an announcement that they trying to figure out to accomodate passengers to other flights. Try to avoid TigerAir at all cost."

I was supposed to fly from Brisbane to Melbourne on Tigerair flight TT541 which was supposed to take off at 7:30 PM on 18th Apr. I reached airport at 4:45 PM and completed my security check-in. Around 5 PM I received a message from Tigerair that the flight has been cancelled. Remember this is the second time that they are cancelling my flight(previously cancelled another flight on 22nd Mar, still I didnt learn). I went to the customer helpdesk and they asked me to call customer care. I called the customer care and they gave me 3 options 1) Cancel my onward journey and they will reimburse the amount 2) They can put me on another flight which is supposed to take-off from Gold Coast the next day morning, but I have to find my own means to reach Gold Coast and also find my own accommodation 3) I can fly on other airlines by buying ticket and they will reimburse the amount I paid for the cancelled flight. As this was my much awaited vacation, I had to go for option 3 by paying 400 dollars from my pocket to book a seat in another flight Later I came to know that for some passengers Tigerair allocated seats in other flights. These passengers didnt have to pay anything extra. But some unlucky souls like me had to book seats in other flights and had to pay extra for that. Worst airline ever. Will never recommend it to anyone"

Very poor customer service at the Tigerair Australia checkin, although I have checked in online using their confusing online checking system but they did not allowed me boarding as they think my my online chekin was incomplete. And despite the 2 hours flight delay as I was forced to purchase a $400 ticket from other airline. I have always heard about the terrible tiger air customer service, but now I’ve seen it my self. "
,Family Leisure,Sydney to Gold Coast,April 2019,3,3,1,2,no,"""Worst LCC I have ever flown""",M Davis,"Not Verified |  Sydney to Gold Coast. Worst LCC I have ever flown. After manually checking in the family at the bag drop desk due to a sporting equipment (bike) piece of luggage, we confirmed our remaining carry on bags didn't need check in due to weight restrictions. We were then pulled aside at the gate for weighing and charged $108 in 'excess' for 3 of our party due to Easter chocs and lollies which took us over the 7kg allowance. At $36 each I requested we 'pool' the extra into 1 bag and be charged $36 for one of us. After querying the policy in light of what the check-in had advised, the gate attendant was confrontational and said she wouldn't re-weigh the items as we were now last to board and may miss our flight. To me, this amounted to extortion under duress given we either paid whatever she decided or we missed our flight. Will never fly Tiger again. False economy."

,Solo Leisure,Brisbane to Sydney,April 2019,2,3,1,2,no,"""trip turned into a nightmare""",D Meares,"✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Sydney. Flight delayed - at 8am I received a text just 3 hrs before scheduled departure, notifying a delay of 1hr 15mins. Travelled to airport, checked in, through security, went to gate as departure board said ""boarding soon"". However, the flight was eventually cancelled about 30 minutes before departure, and passengers were changed to a Virgin flight departing 4hrs 35 mins later, a total delay of 6hrs 50 mins. No real info was given on what to do next. Spent one hour wandering the airport trying to get help/information, before finally learning that I would have to collect baggage and check in again for the new flight. I tried to check in again at auto checkin without success, and was then told can't check in until 1hr before flight departure. So I was stranded downstairs with no access to airport wifi, no comfortable seating to wait on, and having not eaten since 6am. I was only visiting Sydney for 3 days, and lost a whole day as I didn't get to my hotel until 8pm. An enjoyable trip turned into a nightmare. And complaints to Tigerair brought a stock response that passengers should claim on their travel insurance (as if travel insurance negates Tiger-air's failures!). What a shambles - no more Tigerair for me."

So if you fly with them, expect a high chance of being late. Good to know if you have a connecting flight to make."

Brisbane to Melbourne. So you have to be checked in 45 minutes before departure, I woke up at 3am to make sure I was on time. Their was some traffic so my bus was a little late but still within the 45 minutes, I asked the staff women for assistance checking in and they literally looked at me, ignored me and continued talking. By the time they finally assisted me it was past the 45 minute checkin time so they just said oh well you’ve missed it there’s nothing we can do and walked away. I had my 10 month old baby with me too. Not a drop of sympathy or any help with a solution except to pay for new tickets all together. They walked away as I was talking. So rude and no empathy or support what so ever. It’s cheap for a reason."

We were told no Tigerair flights today (5 April) to Adelaide and to join queue for a refund. We have ended up booking a Virgin Australia flight leaving at 6:30 pm. So a day wasted. We have accommodation and car hire booked from mid afternoon so again have spent time trying to sort out a delayed arrival time. I would never book with this airline again. I know all airlines cancel flights but the attitude of the staff (they were all very young) and really couldn’t care less! We were given a number to ring for compensation by said staff, when I got through I was told to go on line, so they didn’t even get this correct. A complete shambles."

Last week they said they’d had a sick crew member (and were nearly two hours late) but not two weeks in a row surely. I foolishly joined the queue last week but not tonight. Nearly everyone on this flight is working age, and they, like me, might be lucky to get 4 hours sleep tonight before we all have to go to work. No food or drink available on board for a month either. I gave it 1/10 because you can’t give zero. Can’t get the FF points to load on 3 flights. Don’t bother flying Tiger."

First bad thing was the staff and crew, starting from the check in time. The girls standing there didn't have the information to convey to the customers and they were rude.

No alternative offered with another carrier or another route As we had ongoing travel arrangements, we were forced to spend upwards of $3000 on last minute tickets with another carrier. Tigerair admitted no liability and no compensation. We had comprehensive travel insurance however were unable to claim as Tigerair cited ""Operational requirements"" as their reason for cancellation and refused to elaborate further, which was not accepted by the insurance company. After sending them several emails asking them for the exact reason for cancellation and also to comment on why we were not offered seats on another flight, we eventually received a curt email stating that they were unable to comment and we were effectively dismissed.  It is clear after reading review after review of customers that have had their plans severely disrupted by this carrier that they do not have any focus on their customer and will withdraw their services to suit themselves."
,Family Leisure,Melbourne to Perth,February 2019,,,1,1,no,"""the flight was cancelled""",Peiman Beig Babaei,"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Perth. We had a flight from Melbourne to Perth on the 17th of February. My wife, my two years old son and arrived to the airport in the evening, checked in our luggage and right away at the moment of heading to the security check, we heard that the flight was cancelled. Simple as that. This cancellation cost us almost AUD1000. Our hotel, car rental, transfers to airport were all gone or cancelled with heavy fines besides the next available flight we could afford was double the price we had booked with Tigerair let aside the expenses of additional nights we had to spend in Melbourne. Of course we are not the only ones and I am sure there were more poeple affected with the same issue, but my most sympathy goes to all those people like us who come from the other side of the world. Our plan to spend a week in Perth was ruined and reduced to 3 days. All these problems happened due to a simple cancellation and all we get is a refund and apology. I have contacted my insurance and they won't help since they consider the airline to be liable and tigerair won't help us as they consider cancellation to have been beyond they control which is nonsense.it's all about money. It's always okay for simple passengers to lose hard-earned money and Tigerair won't care.(everyone on the sae flight will agree with my post as I talked to bunch of them at the Airport). Since I am not getting my money back, I warn everyone with using Tigerair. The chances your flight would get cancelled with this is more than any other airline in Australia."
,Couple Leisure,Sydney to Melbourne,March 2019,,,1,1,no,"""stood in the line for an hour""",Sue Noor,Not Verified |  Sydney to Melbourne. Tigerair cancelled multiple early morning flights with short notice on a Monday morning . There was one staff on the floor who continued to avoid everyone perhaps because he had no idea himself. There was a long line of passengers waiting and it took Tigerair management very long to figure that they need to open extra counters so people could get their flights sorted. Flights do get cancelled however passengers should be afforded the courtesy of quick information without unnecessary delays. We stood in the line for an hour before we could sort out our refund.

Our 8.40 a.m. flight was cancelled just 2 hours in advance and we were given a new flight the next day. We could not accept this as we needed to be in Sydney that specific day. Reading other reviews this is no exception. (Should have read those before booking.) Customer support (who seem to be all non-native English speakers and very hard to understand) not helpful at all. Avoid choosing Tigerair at any cost! Other domestic airlines are similarly priced and more reliable.

On my return home my 7am flight from Sydney to Melbourne was delayed 1.5 hours only notified when arrived at the airport with no option to transfer to a flight around the same time. Don’t fly this airline if you have plans as you are guaranteed to be cancelled or delayed. Very poor customer service dismissing all queries and not providing any options or refunds.

,Solo Leisure,Melbourne to Sydney,January 2019,2,1,1,1,no,"""never had a worse experience""",A Basim,"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Sydney. Tigerair are only interested in making money from customers, and have no interest in customer service. They cancel flights, not attend their service desk, and then charge customer fro not checkin in for flights they canceled. I was checked in on the 7:50am flight from Melbourne to Sydney. On my way to the airport I discovered the flight cancellation message from tigerair and was moved to the 9:35 flight, so I rang and discussed my options with tigerair service. I confirmed that I wanted to be on the 9:35 flight. The lady on the phone confirmed me being on the flight and said nothing to me about having to re check-in. I was at the airport before 7am, and around 7:30 I went to the tigerair desk near the gates to confirm my allocated seat, however, no staff were there at all. I went to the generic airline service desk at terminal 4 and only Jetstar staff were there. A few minutes before 9am, tigerair staff finally showed up. When I asked to confirm my seat they said they can’t allow me on the flight as I haven’t checked in. When I asked them to check me in, they said it is not possible, as this needs to be 45 minutes before the flight, and that other airlines have 30 min guidelines theirs is 45 minutes! I explained that I have been waiting for more than half hour for staff here and no one was there, I was told not the only way to get a flight on the day was that I get back outside to the terminal to the tigerair check in area and pay $85 to get on the 11:05 flight. The flight at 11 was also delayed and I arrived 5 hours later. That very same week, my return flight was also canceled with tiger, and had to find another flight and ended up paying nearly $400 one-way ticket. Tigerair policy is simply focused on taking advantage of customers. What is extraordinary is the response from staff, having explained to the manager and trying and reason with her and get her to think from the customer perspective, having done everything I was meant to do checking in 23 hours before the flight and that the changes were not mine in the first place. Also being in the airport since 7 there is no reason for me not to intentionally check-in, also verifying that they can see the phone call I made this morning on record, agreeing to be on the 9:35 flight. The manager showed indifference to my experience as a customer, and even worse, having lodged a complaint to the complaints department they offered a single response backing their earlier response and stopped responding to my email and complaint, not even offering an apology. I honestly have never had a worse experience. Never again!"
,Family Leisure,Melbourne to Sydney,February 2019,1,2,1,1,no,"""wont be flying Tigerair again""",Joseph Vella,"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Sydney. A family trip to Sydney on the weekend took a turn for the worse when our flight to Sydney on Friday evening was cancelled 3 hours before hand due to operational requirements. We received a text message with our new flight details on the first flight on Saturday. A bit annoyed but seeing there was a huge storm in Sydney that night not their fault, and I was actually impressed with with how quick and efficient they were in notifying us and rebooking our flight. However it all went to custard the next morning. We got up early to catch the 6.45am flight. On route to the airport we checked the flight status at Melbourne Airport and it was listed as cancelled. We rang Tiger Air who confirmed that the flight was still running. Seeing that we didnt received a txt or email from Tiger we assumed all was good. When we got to the airport however the flight was indeed cancelled and the customer service people were absolutely hopeless. We ran to the Qantas service desk where the most lovely and helpful staff managed to get us the last 3 seats on a 8.00am flight. It was expensive as you would imagine. The only positive thing was that the refund process was quick and simple I dont expect a first class experience from a budget airline, however because they dont have a big fleet of aircraft when incidents like this happen they cannot recover quickly enough. I wont be flying TigerAir again"
,Solo Leisure,Sydney to Melbourne,February 2019,,,1,1,no,"""conduct today is inexcusable""",R Aldrich,"Not Verified |  Sydney to Melbourne. I received this message from Tiger at 6:53 this morning (less than 10 minutes before I was meant to leave for the airport): ""Your flight TT221 SYD-MEL 09/02/19, departure time 8:45, has been cancelled due to operational requirements. New flight TT287 10/02/19, with a revised departure time of 21:45."" My flight had been delayed for 37 hrs. My weekend trip to Melbourne was now going to start at 9:45pm on Sunday. I called customer support, thinking, ""surely this is a mistake"". Over an hour later someone finally picks up the phone. There's been no mistake. So it looks like I'm just not going to Melbourne after all. So now I ask about compensation, assuming Tiger will refund me for the return trip and hoping they'll also cover my accommodation. Never assume with Tiger. Apparently, they can refund me for the flight they cancelled (if I send an email to accounts) but, because I booked through Expedia, they can only give me a store credit for the return flight. And there's no guarantee I'll get anything back for accommodation. I can say with confidence that if Tiger does not refund both my flights and accommodation I will never fly with them again. It is not worth saving a few bucks on flights if you end up with no flight at all. I have now spent hundreds of dollars on absolutely nothing. And this isn't even the first time this has happened to me. The only other time I've flown Tiger was to Perth in 2017. That time they cancelled my returning flight, and put me on the same flight a day later. That was inconvenient but redeemable because they gave us a month's notice, put us on the next Tiger flight and at least it meant my holiday was longer (not non-existent). Tiger's conduct today is inexcusable. My weekend, which was meant to be spent celebrating my birthday, has been ruined, and for the privilege I am out of pocket."

There was a delay departing (about 45 min) but all the staff were (genuinely) friendly. Although Tigerair is a budget airline the overall experience I had was very positive.

At 62 years of age my experience with Tigerair was the worst airline experience ever. The flight was cancelled on the same day I was flying. I had paid for my accommodation and a training course at my destination but apparently that was just bad luck... sorry for the inconvenience in spite of explains it had taken me a while to save the necessary money. I was told there were no more available flights to book me on for a couple of days in spite of advertised flights online with available seats. Oh and in spite of advising I did not have the money to book another airline, they further advised it would take 10 days to get my money back.  I believe their partners as in this case was Gotogate overbook and then cancel those who paid the least, as I didn't take any of the many promoted add ons. I highly recommend paying extra with a decent and reputable airline over a cheaper airline that pushes add ons and then dumps you from the flight. I will not get back my paid accommodation or course money."

The operator didn’t care and was uninterested in helping us with an alternative. It may well have been cancelled due to the strike they were planning the following day. I will never flyTiger again.

I will be doing this on a regular basis but there is no way in the world I will book this airline again, the amount of negativity I have had since from people about this airline backs up my reasons.

I was then asked to pay on on-the-spot fee of $48. Also, the ground staff person was very rude and arrogant and showed zero sympathy for my situation. His only concern was in how I was going to pay.

Advised me they have no recovery flight only 3 days later that’s been cancelled an hour later then another 5 days later. While they advertised the cancelled flight for sale on different website. They said they won’t refund the return ticket, because that flight hasn’t been affected, which is because if I won’t leave I can’t return. To annoy me some more they keep sending me confirmation email about the return flight. Not to mention I have wrote them numerous complaints no response. If they ever want to refund the money for a flight they would do in 3 weeks, which I doubt! but they could take money straight away.

Prior to the flight, the airline had done a good job at keeping us informed about a possible pilot go-slow that might have caused us problems. We had to wait a long time for our baggage at Hobart, but this is almost certainly an airport problem (it was very busy on the weekend before Christmas).

While on a business trip to Sydney we decided to purchase the travel insurance offered by Tiger air on there booking website. On our return journey the plane had an engineering problem which made us return to Sydney. We were then told the next flight available to get home was in 48 hrs. Tigerair offered us 1 night's accommodation and a place on the flight in 48 hrs at no charge. I was not concerned as we had taken out the Tigerair insurance to cover the short fall of staying in Sydney (transport,accommodation, meals). Upon returning home I lodged my insurance claim which was very straight forward and we had kept the expenses to a minimum so I was confident that that claim would not be a problem, however it would now appear that having a travel delay with Tigerair, the very airline that we were insured with is not covered. This is the response from Chubb Insurance Australia. Our decision After careful review of the information provided to us, we regret to advise that your policy is unable to respond to this claim as the cancellation of your flight was due to Tigerair engineering requirements. As outlined above, any loss caused by a transport provider delay, cancellation or rescheduling is unfortunately excluded from cover. In addition, we note that you accepted the recovery flight offered by Tigerair deeming your airfares as used. Please be advised Section 1 can only provide cover for the unused portion of a Tigerair ticket or the costs of re-scheduling a Tigerair ticket. Should you have additional documentation that may alter our decision, please feel free to forward it to us at your earliest convenience. Although this may not be the outcome that you had hoped for, we trust that the above explanation has given you a better understanding of your policy coverage. If you are unsatisfied with our claim assessment or the service that you have received, please refer to the attached brochure which outlines Chubb Insurance’s complaint handling process. Please feel free to contact us at the above address or by phone if you have further queries regarding this matter, noting your claim number as a reference."

This is a nickel and dime to death airline. The baggage machine reader wasn’t working correctly, so had to wait for the two available people to work through several customers to get my bag checked. Got to the gate and found my carryon was 2kgs too heavy - there were two people standing by to process the additional payments from many passengers. Clearly this is nothing more than a money maker for them. Not an issue of aircraft weight since you can pay the extra $40 (for 2kgs!) and walk on board, and if the extra weight had been in my checked bag, they would have never known. But because you’re at the gate, you have no choice but to pay. I accept their policies are posted on the website, but the restrictions are tight, and the charges ridiculous.

To cancel a flight 30mins before boarding and then having to wait 3+ weeks after the cancelled flight to have the refund ""approved"" which just means a form is sent out to be completed and will have to wait another 3+ weeks for the refund to be actually processed. 2 Months wait for a refund?!

Our experience this weekend with tiger was the worst airline experience I have ever had. Our flight on Saturday morning was expected to leave at 9:35am, but it was delayed until 1:55pm. The main issue I have is the lack of communication and compensation for time lost. There was no communication as to what time our flight was being changed to until 11:30. We were simply sitting around for two hours without hearing anything from the staff. When they finally told us our flight would now leave at 1:55, they offered us a $5 meal voucher. Now I'm not sure if they have looked at the food prices at Melbourne airport lately, but $5 doesn't buy you much! For a 4.5 hour delay I would expect more like $10-$15. On our flight back home on Sunday night from Brisbane to Melbourne, another bad experience. Once again a flight delay, this time our originally scheduled 9:15 pm flight home was going to leave at 11:15pm, and there was absolutely zero communication from the staff. No announcenent, nothing. We found out on Google that out flight was delayed. Due to this delay our long term car park we had booked in Melbourne charged us extra because we overstayed our visit, and we only overstayed our visit because of Tiger.

My wallet fell out of my pocket when I was getting up from my seat on my flight on July 12th. I noticed while I was coming down the steps onto the tarmac, I was not allowed to go back and check my seat. The crew on the tarmac told me to go to the gate and another crew member would bring my wallet down to me. I was one of the very last off the plane. The crew started boarding the plane almost immediately after we came through the gate. We then had to wait an hour with no communication as to whether or not they had looked for it or if it had been found. The crew couldn't even care enough to actually look at my seat for it and didn't ask for a description. When I called the airline the following day I was told I had to e-mail ""customer care"" to check for lost property. Crew didn't let me know they had found my wallet until the following day, after I had cancelled all my cards and paid to replace my drivers licence. I thought a customer service line would respond right away if they had found something so important. They told me if I wanted to get my wallet back that I had to pay for them to post it back to me. I paid for and sent them an envelope almost two weeks ago and they have not returned my wallet to me. I have been in contact with Tigerair in regards to this, and they repeatedly ignore me and my e-mails. The customer service with this airline is abysmal.

The flight was delayed and instead of getting an apology, the extremely rude staff made me pay 36 AUD because my carry on was 1.5 k more than their 7k limit, and insisted she had to count my laptop bag as well. I could see that others were getting away with much heavier bags but she was just making a fuss out of nothing for my bag (I don't have an Aussie accent so she gave me a completely different attitude)."

It was the first time I was to fly with Tiger and they cancelled the flight via text and email. I immediately called customer service which is based in the Philippines and waited 15 minutes for someone to answer the phone. After 20 minutes on a mobile phone I realised that I would not be provided with any assistance. I went to the airport and waited two and a half hours for Tiger Airways staff to get to work at 6.30pm. To say Tiger Airways staff are unhelpful is a gross understatement. They could not give a rats about the customer at all, in fact their complete lack of ability to provide assistance was incredulous. Their idea of assistance was for me to sleep at the airport in the clothes I was wearing, go without food or showering and my prescription medication for the next two days. The fact that they are required to put passengers on the next available flight doesn't hold for them if there are no seats available. I was asked haughtily if I had read their terms and conditions. Now I have to wait two weeks to get my money back and they refused to give me a receipt. Disgraceful airline, rude staff with no empathy or common sense and appalling service. Tiger Airlines business practices need to be investigated. To make matters worse all the other airlines jacked up their prices to take cancelled passengers on board. I slept at the airport and had to pay $552 to fly one way to Sydney the next morning. Just a horrible stressful experience and I will never choose Tigerair again."

The individuals concerned were loud, swearing and jumping around in the their seats continually reclining the seat and generally being quite obnoxious. The crew seemed to think their behaviour was OK and a great start to their holiday. It spoilt my flight and that of the person sitting next to me. I don't believe alcohol is necessary at 9.30am I'm not adverse to a drink on a flight but this was not necessary. Overall think Tiger great value but will rethink my next flights. "

I received a text from the airline to say that my flight was cancelled due to technical problems with the aircraft. The call centre told me that i had two options, a flight to Sydney on the 5th, or a flight to the Gold Coast on the day. Picked the latter because i did not want to pay accomodation charges in Australia's most expensive city. I mentioned to a member of Tigerair staff at the kiosk at Sydney airport that I had been bumped off the flight. Her reply ""why do you keep flying on this airline"". Hardly filled me with confidence.

,Solo Leisure,Sydney to Adelaide,June 2018,4,4,1,1,no,"""dispensed with good customer service""",G Matthews,"✅ Trip Verified | A regular flyer with Tigerair on the Sydney-Adelaide route, I presented myself at the automatic boarding pass machine at the departure terminal at Kingsford-Smith Airport domestic terminal at 08.01 am for a scheduled 08.45 am departure on Tuesday 12th June 2018. I had no baggage to check-in and normally would have downloaded a boarding pass prior to arriving at the airport so as to avoid contact with this airline's arrogant and rude ground staff. The automatic boarding machine told me that check-in was closed, so I spoke to the female at the start of the Tigerair check-in race who told me that check-in was closed and that I could not fly that day but could get onto a flight on Wednesday for an additional fee of $85. Given that I had no check-in baggage and would normally not even present myself at this counter, I stood my ground and was eventually given a boarding pass. I dashed to Gate 57 to find that the lounge was still full of customers and believe it or not, the aircraft to service the flight had not yet arrived at the gate. The aircraft arrived at 08.15 am and the arriving passengers commenced disembarkation at 08.22 am. Boarding for my flight commenced at 08.32 am. I believe that an unethical method is being used by Tigerair to scam timid customers into paying an additional fee under such circumstances when in the 'olden days' good customer service would have seen a boarding pass issued given that there was no reason not to do so on the part of the airline. Tigerair is a low cost airline, which according to its latest propaganda on page 5 of it's 'tigertales' magazine provides 'value, choice and innovation'. But in the scramble to make money it has dispensed with good customer service and employs arrogant and rude ground staff to intimidate customers. Sometimes it is better to pay a bit more to fly on a competitor, but always stand up for your rights as a paying customer!"

There was no help on the ground, 1 staff trying to deal with 150 plus people that were understandably very upset. We had to take the refund option and then pay $2000 to a fly to Perth with Qantas. No help at all on the ground or trying to help people make other arrangements. It’s not good enough to leave people stranded tourists, old people and we also had young children ourselves. I would expect a full refund of the fair to Perth and a reimbursement of a Tigerair fair to Perth with such short notice. To leave people stranded is  very unfair and terrible customer service. "

Our flight got cancelled due to bad weather conditions, which I can agree is a good call to make if it’s dangerous to fly.  What amazes me by this though is that no effort was made by any of the team at Tiger Air to get us on a new flight. After doing my own research I found I could get a flight through Virgin or Qantas leaving 3 hours later but was going to cost me almost double in price to get it as it was a last minute flight. Flights cancel all the time, there is no stopping that. How the airline chose to deal with ‘paying back’ their customers, sending out random emails telling them they are lucky winners and can board the next available flight free of charge, while everyone else just goes home is just ridiculous. I learned as I walked away from the airport with all my luggage and missing the biggest competition of my career is that, cheap is not always better. "

My wife was a little uneasy knowing her luggage weighed right on the maximum allowed @ 7kg, but hadn't realised they would also be weighing most ladies handbags. And I say, ""most ladies handbags"", because the lady before us did not have to weigh her handbag along with her rather large duffel bag. However, after my wife's handbag and carry on bag weigh in came in at just under 8kg, staff insisted she pay an extra $36 dollars on the spot. When my wife and I protested her inconsistent procedure with the previous passenger, staff became rude and defensive, insinuating we were liars and further insisting we pay up right away. We  requested to speak with her supervisor, to which she rudely replied, ""oh look, you can put a complaint in writing on our website if you like"". At which point, both my wife and I became adamant about speaking with someone higher up in the ranking. And we were glad we did, because after describing this, so called, 'customer service' team member's unprofessional behaviour, we were both permitted to board the flight without further payment or harassment.

After we had checked in we had bought presents from duty free; and they added this to the weight limit, refusing to let us remove the extra baggage and made us pay an extra 40 dollars.

The staff were rude, there was no explanation for the fact that I was unable to take my freshly bought, sealed coffee aboard the flight considering there were other passengers that were clearly allowed their beverages in the plane. The air hostess was rude and argumentative when explaining safety procedures and when she asked if we had any questions and one of the passengers asked one, she preceded to tell him that he should have listened in the first place and to look at the safety procedure on the back of the seat. I will not be flying Tigerair again and will be informing everyone of our poor experience this morning. I also believe that although Tigerair purport to be a budget airline, you appear to profiteer from the meagre cabin bag allowance by charging customers extreme prices for small excess luggage. I fly often, both nationally and internationally for business and I have never experienced such poor service. Lift your game Tigerair or the passengers will speak with their money when they continue to book other airlines who are just as reasonably priced but offer a much better customer experience!"

Even if you are just a little over they will still make you pay a ridiculous amount. The first time I had to pay $36 and then the second time I had to pay $46. Where did the extra $10 come from.

I was ready to write a glowing review. However, the leg from BNE to MEL was a disaster. The flight was delayed and so people were slowly notified whilst waiting at the gate. There were a number of ground staff about and they made everyone weigh their bags to ensure they were under the weight limit. No real updates, aside from a delay due to engineering. And then an SMS comes through over an hour later saying it had been cancelled. No notification from actual staff, and no staff at the gate. So, I called their call centre as advised in the SMS. I was told that a recovery flight was being organised but I would have to check in. I go down to the check in counter and there is one staff member, who is having IT issues. After about 20 minutes she still hasn't served those people, all the while the entire planeload of people have now formed a queue. There's also no visibility of other staff. Unfortunately for some, they are trying to check in for actual operating flights and they are getting noticeably quite distressed in the queue. About 45 minutes later Sebastien, a ground staff member, makes an announcement over the PA which can only be heard away from the queue. I then go and ask what the announcement said as there's about 40 people who were all going ""what was he saying??"". I'm advised there is no recovery flight and there are no seats out of Brisbane until at least the following day. There may be spots from the Gold Coast, but best option would be to check other airlines. I had to be back in Melbourne that day (noting I was on a 2.10pm flight, so not cutting it fine by any stretch of the imagination). I ended up flying Qantas. I have received no follow up from Tiger about the cancellation - no email about 'what to do now' or anything. After a few days, I contacted them to ask the process. I got a reply that completely ignored what I had said. Not even an offer to reimburse my original flight costs. So, after many glowing reviews on here (e.g. my review from late Jan - MEL:ADL) it seems that when Tigerair get things wrong, they really get them wrong. No customer service at all. Sorry, Tiger but you really dropped the ball."
,Solo Leisure,Gold Coast to Melbourne,March 2018,1,,1,1,no,"""I would never recommend Tigerair""",K Sarveer,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gold Coast to Melbourne. Worst service ever. On 6th Mar I reached at the airport just 2 mins before the checkin close time. Departure time was 9:35 Am. I was just on time because there was bad weather and i had to travel to gold coast airport for about 45 mins where it should take about 20-25 mins on normal weather conditions. While i was searching for counter it took me about 2-3 mins and checkin was closed. I asked the staff to help me as its just about 3 mins, they said its very late now. You have to book another flight. Just 2-3 mins! They just wanted to earn money and this they didn't let me board-in. So I had to pay again for another flight on same day that was scheduled after about 5 hours. Such a bad experience. I would never recommend Tigerair to anyone. If this is the case, then if the flights are delayed, they should refund the money to customers, if they are so strict with customer checkin time."

Poor customer service Tiger, cancelled flight, no notification and no alternatives that night or the following morning. A credit note only on offer, no refund, a refusal in fact.

We arrived early for check in even though we already checked in online. The lady working the till proceeds to tel us there is no express line, and to go in the same line as everyone else. We followed those instructions, then randomly she starts taking people through the express line who came to the airport after everyone else. This made our wait time even longer, and people who arrived after us and cut the line got top priority even though we did the same online check in and could’ve already been through. Our flight was supposed to leave at 9:15 am, and the airport has been calling people to go back through check in now to get a paper copy of their boarding passes instead of using the electronic ones on their smartphones. So people had to basically check in two times now, and we aren’t even close to boarding yet even though our flight was supposed to leave over 45 minutes ago. We have to catch a bus after the airport because our travel time doesn’t end after our flight. We are now most likely going to miss the bus we already paid for. We are frustrated, mad, and in disbelief at this atrocious customer service. This is the worst airline we have ever flown with and will not make this mistake of flying with them ever again!"

One hour later flight cancelled, yes the usual technical problems (as if anyone believes this anymore) and the plane is stranded on the Gold Coast. Tiger offered us a flight with Virgin at 7am the following morning which was too late for us. Why can't you fly us out tonight on Virgin, answer from a smarmy smirking young woman at the Tiger desk can't do it tonight. We need to be in Sydney tonight we told her, her response ""Well you're not the only ones you know"". Such empathy. How strange my wife an I were able to book a flight with Virgin leaving at 8pm but Tiger couldn't do the same thing for us. As far as I am concerned you are a disgrace to the sky you use."

David Robson",✅ Trip Verified | I travelled from Cairns to Brisbane on Tiger Australia on the 12th January 2018. It was a great flight as usual and very comfortable. It arrived into Brisbane after the last train had left but there was still a 11pm shuttle which I took to the Brisbane Transit Center. The driver of the shuttle actually dropped me off in the Brisbane CBD to help me out. I will travel on Tiger Australia in the future.

They have changed our flight times by over 8 hours and therefore we are going to miss basically a whole day of our stay near to the Barrier Reef. The car hire company are now closed when we arrive so we’ve had to book with another company at an extra cost. We’ve also paid for accommodation and missing out on that for the whole day. Their customer relations are unbelievably apathetic to it all, just basically stating their terms and conditions and we can have a refund, but it’s now too late to book with another airline because of the cost. Never will I fly with them again."

We said we will throw 1 of our bag. Then she told another guy ""remember these people's faces and check them again"" and threatened us as if we were robbers.  We paid money to fly and we shouldn't be treated as if she did a favor for us. We had a very good trip in Tasmania but thanks to this staff, we ended up with bad feelings because of not being treated like human beings. This is the second time we traveled with Tigerair. We were very happy with its service and staff except this time. I know this is low cost airlines but even it's cheap, we also have rights to be treated like human beings."

Good: The flight was at a great price point for a day before a public holiday (over $100 cheaper than the full service airlines per person), the cabin crew were friendly and professional, and the flight pushed back right on time and arrived 10 minutes early. The 737 seems to have more leg room than the A320 also used by Tiger. Pre-booked breakfast and the meal was quite tasty. Bad: The flight being rescheduled from 0820 to 0725. Not a killer, and they did give the option of moving flights or a full refund so there were other options available. Overall, I've generally had excellent flights with Tiger so I'm either 'lucky' or those who have good experiences don't bother with reviews."

C Mitchell","✅ Trip Verified | Cairns to Melbourne and back on Dec 1st. Both flights delayed for more than one hour. In Cairns, we were explained that the delay is due to ATC, however all the flights by the competitor were on time. Another delay on my way back. Moreover, at Melbourne domestic airport, all the shops and coffee outlets are closed at 10pm. Plane was not comfortable at all with a very limited leg room. When compared to European low cost airlines, which I am using frequently, this one was nowhere close. Information regarding the actual boarding time in both Cairns and Melbourne were chaotic. Overall, disappointing experience."
,Family Leisure,Brisbane to Melbourne,November 2017,,,1,1,no,"""stranded in Melbourne""",J Falla,"✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Melbourne. This airline left 4 adults and 2 very small children stranded in Melbourne and the only flight they would offer was 2 days later with no compensation except a refund of the fare paid which would take 2 weeks. We were waiting on the phone for an hour and half, then a queue for the same time, to be told that due to technical difficulties our flight was not going. We had to buy other flights to enable us to catch later flights at another airport that night for 1 person and to be at our jobs for the others, the extra nights accommodation and taxi fares and flights left us out of pocket over $3000. They refuse to do anything. Travel insurance doesn't cover technical difficulties and credit cards don't cover domestic travel, they had 4 staff on the floor that had no idea what to do. We had no car, no milk, no nappies and apart from the stress we also lost hundreds of dollars for not getting back to work. This is appalling and i wonder if it is not a rip off."

G Lam","✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Hobart. I didn't expect much from such a low-cost airline and this was pretty much within my expectations. The section dedicated to Tigerair in Tullamarine airport wasn't bad, featuring decent chairs with power outlets in certain locations. What's worth noting is that prior to boarding, the ground crew will bring a weight scale to make sure you don't exceed your 7kg cabin baggage restriction. Once onboard (by walking across the tarmac, what do you expect?), the cabin crew showed a positive attitude, and they seem very happy to help out passengers wither with difficulties locating their seats or placing oversized items into the overhead locker. The seat was acceptable for a 55-minute flight, the pitch was average and feels pretty comfortable. One thing to note is that is my case, the window was coated with a layer of grease, probably due to the previous passenger leaning his or her greasy hair against the table while sleeping. For some reasons, they seem to really like to use the reverse thrust, even with plenty of runway distance to spare. The overall experience was acceptable for the price, and yes, I would recommend it."
,Couple Leisure,Melbourne to Sydney,November 2017,1,1,1,1,no,"""Clearly very unsatisfactory indeed""",H Gibson,"✅ Trip Verified | Our 11.10 am flight from Melbourne to Sydney was cancelled, ostensibly due to ""weather"" (although at that time things in Melbourne seemed OK). We found out about this after arriving at the airport. We were rebooked on a flight at 6.25 pm the next day. We were told that this was the next flight with seats available. I know flying a budget airline means you take a risk that there might be a delay, but I find it extremely unsatisfactory that we were expected to wait for over a day for what should be a straight-forward flight from Melbourne to Sydney. The Tigerair staff at the airport offered no assistance and no compensation, and told us that that if we wanted to cancel the next day's flight, all we would receive would be a credit for the fare we had paid. Because of the excessive wait, we had no alternative but to pay ""walk up"" fares on another airline, and all we have from Tigerair is a credit but no refund. Clearly very unsatisfactory indeed."

Many elderly passengers on board. One ground crew member escorted an elderly passenger on board and other crew helped passengers find overhead locker space. I was impressed.

,Solo Leisure,Sydney to Melbourne,November 2017,1,1,1,1,no,"""Customer service was horrid""",J Beane,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Melbourne. The main attraction was that they cater for a selection of dietary requirements. Being a Gluten Free Vegan the temptation of a Rowie’s Burger took over and I thought I would give them a shot. From the onset even before boarding my experience was horrible. The customer service was appalling - the stewardesses were rude and didn’t smile. I was  shocked they included my handbag (which can’t even fit a tablet in!) as weighed luggage. Upon paying for my .5 excess of 7kg luggage limit which was due to my handbag I was refused a receipt. The staff  also did not have change for a $50 note and had to request smaller change or to somehow get change for her current float. After that incident I was sitting when I was approached several times asking to re-weigh my bags which I said I had. They had no record of my weighing - and requested a receipt. I went back to the stewardess at the counter and requested a receipt in light of the circumstances. It seemed she did not know how to issue one, after calling for her she advised me I have to go to another gate as her printer was down. After going to two other Tiger gates it seems the third gate was the only one able to print. Eventually when I did board - after the delayed departure they seemed to miss my pre-ordered meal. I reminded them 30 mins prior to the scheduled landing that I had a pre-ordered meal. I was promptly given  my allocated drink but was disallowed from having my tray down as we had begun our descent. They offered me a chicken or beef sandwich in compensation to my misplaced meal - which was a silly offer as I clearly ordered a dietary specific menu item. I was finally treated to my pre-ordered in-flight meal which arrived once I landed. Not only was it overcooked and the box it was served it had leaked sauce in but it was also cold. There was no point ordering food at all. All in all for an $89 flight, $13 in-flight meal and $36 luggage fee I may as well of forked out the extra $20 and flown a seamless journey with Virgin. Customer service was horrid, their operational rules had double standards and the food was lack lustre."

Didn't know until I got to the airport. 2 hr queue to service desk only to be told flight rescheduled to following day. Meaning wasted day in Adelaide. Couldn't wait so re-booked with another airline at own expense. And this is not the first time. Frequent cancellations at the airport and re-scheduling. What is the point of a low fare ticket if you end up paying heaps more for last minute ticket with another airline. Last minute cancellations and re-timing are the norm with Tiger. False economy using Tiger. Avoid unless you are very flexible with your time, have no commitments and have lots of spare cash on hand to pay for flight on a reliable airline at the last minute. Fly Tiger at your own peril. I would give them a 0 rating but website won't let me."
,Family Leisure,Sydney to Melbourne,September 2017,2,2,2,1,no,"""incompetent and insensitive""",Niamh Gallagher,"✅ Verified Review |  Sydney to Melbourne. After arriving at Sydney airport on 23/9/2017 at 10:30 (2hrs before departure), I received a sms stating my flight had been cancelled due to ""engineering requirements"", my new flight would be on 24/9/2017 at 13:50. I'll admit I didn't notice the date change, originally thought we had been delayed by 2 hours. I showed one of the check-in staff (who also didn't notice the date change), she told me I couldn’t check-in until 12pm (2 hrs before the new flight). So my toddler and I sat around the airport for 1.5hrs, frustrated but fine. When I tried to check-in at noon it was pointed out to me that my flight was not until the following day. My toddler and I were flying to Melb for my Mum's 70th b’day dinner (which was a big deal as my Mum has been fighting stage 4 cancer for the last year - family were coming from interstate, it was much needed celebration). When I explained the importance of our trip I was told I could try another airline (which by this stage were sold out - it was the footy finals and start of school hols), get a refund, go on standby or come back tomorrow. I wasn't pleased with any of the options, but thought the best chance was to go standby. So we waited another 2.5hrs. I asked if we would get a food voucher for a sandwich for my daughter and got a very blunt ""no"". At 2:30 after the final call for the 3:15 Melbourne flight, we went back to the original check-in girl (who had stated that she had put us ""top of the standby list""), she told us ""40 passengers are yet to book in, so it looks good for you"" (so we were feeling relieved) 20mins later another staff member came & told us (& 6 other passengers who had gone standby after the cancellation) the flight was booked & the best they could offer was a 7am flight.  The 7am flight was not an option for us. I then had to try & sort my airport parking, fun, fun. On our return flight, somehow my toddler and I were assigned seats in different rows! The cabin staff told me this had happened twice on the flight already. They did their best to reshuffle people, but we ended up sitting with an aisle between us.  I emailed Tiger with my complaints and suggested compensation of Tiger credit to fly later in the year. They offered their ""sincere apologies"" but told me because I didn't take out insurance they were not going to offer any compensation. This baffled me!? Instead of offering $100 they would rather have a very unsatisfied customer? So I emailed them again and was told ""we appreciate your understanding in this matter"". I know flying a budget airline you take a risk of being delayed - but delayed by an hour or two, not 26! And not to be told then too bad, take out insurance next time. I wont be flying Tiger again, they’re incompetent and insensitive."

My wife and I were booked to fly on 9th July on flight TT272 departing at 7:40pm. We arrived at the airport in time to check in and were notified the flight had been cancelled. The ground staff provided no further information and did not show any interest in providing help or advice. After hunting around for the TigerAir office along with a bunch of other passengers who were booked on the same flight we finally found what were looking for and was then told to wait outside, someone would be along to help. After 15 minutes a ground staff person did come by and explained that we were all booked for a flight the next morning. When asked what we were supposed to do until then we were advised that we could make our own arrangements for accommodation and be reimbursed for the cost, again no help was offered to assist. It was now after 9pm so through the Visitors Centre located in the airports concourse I found a room at the local Best Western motel and paid for it at the Centre to lock in the booking. We arrived at the hotel and checked in ok, and the next morning caught the flight to Sydney. 2 days later I contacted TigerAir to request he promised reimbursement. Since then I have exchanged over 18 emails with TigerAirs Customer Care team - a misnomer if ever their was one - with repeated request from them to supply proof of hotel expense which I did each time the request was made. All to no avail. On the 2nd September I raised a complaint with the Airline Customer Care Advocate, supplied copies of the requested documents and have followed up with them for a resolution, again to no avail Its now 12 weeks since I first asked for my reimbursement, something that TigerAir's own website says is their policy to provide, and still no resolution.

Brian Lamprell","✅ Verified Review |  Sydney to Adelaide and Tigerair return fare was best value. A couple of annoying events, the first of which was the booking and on-line check in on the Tigerair site. Like most people I don’t want to have a multitude of advertisements hitting on me while I’m trying to concentrate on the booking. I ended up with email spam from the Tigerair affiliates. Similarly, the on-line check in is also unnecessarily complicated when it could be so simple. Pre-boarding I asked for an aisle seat and the Tigerair staffer was so polite and helpful and the seat was changed with no fuss at all. At boarding lounge 49 the ground crew announcements were spoken so fast it was unintelligible. One passenger asked me what was said and I was unable to tell him. When I very politely suggested to the Tigerair staffer to slow down his delivery, he replied, “Other passengers can understand it”. If so, why are the passengers lining up in the wrong places and at wrong times? The flight was uneventful with friendly cabin attendants and punctual departure and arrival. A late-morning flight ADL to SYD was booked but on-line check in was a problem as I had no internet access for 24 hours. I found a Tigerair staffer in the airport who kindly directed me to the check-in area. Arriving there, there was no check in desk open. Within two minutes, the same Tigerair staffer offered to help me. He was friendly, efficient did the check in and seat allocation in about 2 minutes. Later at the boarding gate his announcements were clear, precise and audible, unlike his female offsider who could not be heard above the noise of the passengers. The flight departed 10 minutes late and arrived 10 minutes late. The on board crew were pleasant and professional and the flight proceeded smoothly."
,Solo Leisure,Sydney to Melbourne,June 2017,1,1,1,1,no,"""cancelled very late in the evening""",C Richards,"✅ Verified Review |  Flight was cancelled very late in the evening. Tigerair initially blamed the weather, which was quite wet at the time but others seemed to be coping with it. I was able to get onto a Jetstar flight at my own additional cost. Since that date (9th June 2017) I have been in touch with Tigerair via email, seeking an explanation as to their cavalier attitude to my needs on that night. They eventually conceded that it wasn't the weather, but 'Engineering Requirements', but have since sought to alter that to 'Engineering Requirements and weather'. They have also refused to discuss why it took so long to advise that the flight was cancelled. I have discovered that the aircraft concerned was still airborne on its way to Melbourne from Cooloongatta at the time it should have been leaving Melbourne for Sydney (6.25 pm), but it took Tigerair until 8.20 pm to send their 3 line email cancelling the flight. Someone in Tigerair should have known by 6.25 pm at the latest that there was a problem. Tigerair refused to discuss this aspect of their service, except to say how hard their job is."

Flights were both on time and very comfortable, although 2C needs wonky armrest fixing. Reasonable drinks and snack prices and plenty of water offered. I got the special deal of $200 return - an absolute bargain for first class service from everyone. Well Done Tiger AU - a big thumbs up from a very seasoned traveller."
,Couple Leisure,Sydney to Melbourne ,April 2017,1,1,1,2,no,"""get what you pay for - terrible service""",K O'Hegarty,"✅ Verified Review | I have never in my life been more disappointed in an airline. Tigerair has to be the worst airline I have ever dealt with. My partner and I are having dinner with a few friends on Friday night, excited for our flight from Sydney to Melbourne the next morning – only to be dimmed when we receive a message saying they cancelled our 8.15am Saturday flight and they have put us on the flight at 3.15pm on Sunday. They could only put us on a flight 38 hours after they cancelled our first one. Because this was only a weekend away and we were leaving Tuesday – I brought a flight on Saturday with Virgin who were much more understanding and helpful. $600 down, Virgin did everything to make sure we were happy and tried to accommodate us after hearing how Tigerair treated us. When I asked Tiger for a refund for this, we were refused one and said the best they can do is a credit. Are you serious? Like I’m ever going to use this airline again. Yes, the flights are cheaper however, you get what you pay for - terrible service. Wouldn’t you prefer to pay $100 or so extra and be guaranteed a flight when you book it for and even better customer service from anyone else."
,Family Leisure,Sydney to Perth,January 2017,3,4,1,4,no,"""another Australian rip off""",Martin Augood,"✅ Verified Review |  This review is based on 2 return trips for my sons from Sydney to meet me in Perth. For the return leg, we were emailed/SMS just four hours before departure. They claimed simply Operational reasons - no further information whatsoever. After calling Customer service and in total over 60 minutes on phone, they agreed to put us in hotel in Perth. We checked with Hotel and there was no booking made for us, so we made alternative accommodation booking. everything was so inconvenient. My sons were re-booked next day on different flights back to sydney using Virgin OZ. one of those flights was re-booked by virgin themselves, without telling us untill at counter, meaning the Son.2 didn't get back until 24hrs after the scheduled return with Tigerair. Well they got back safely. But no compensation at all for the delay and loss of ones days work, and over 300km extra driving and all other expenses. Im used to Europe where after 4hrs Airline pays delay money and expenses. Whats make this Worse, i had Purchased Tigerair insurance. Which in fact is covered by CHUBB.com.AU, and you have to make the claim on seperate forms, receipts etc, not obvious when you buy the insurance. And they do not pay anything when its tiger-air problems- Classed as Operation Reasons. yet another Australian rip off. TIP, if you can afford it use a better airline. and if you are tempted by the Good prices. Dump the Insurance."

Very disappointed with Tigerair Australia baggage policy and will never fly again with them. I was on a flight to Sydney to catch a connecting intercontinental flight. I had two pieces of luggage over 20kgs and when I checked in was told not to worry that i would be given consideration and a solution would be found (as on line one can only add and pay for extra 8kg only). Finally on top of the 60AUD ticket and another 30 dollars for an extra piece of luggage, Tigerair charged me 320AUD for extra kgs over their 40kg limit at check in. Customer service was no better and four months later told me that its my fault. No customer respect. "

My how the worm turns from being a beneficial symbiotic relationship to a greedy, unprofessional, money grabbing vulture. This ultra LCC really needs to justify it's existence. Incompetent, rude and full of self-importance, this airline has one flight each day from Hobart to Melbourne. No other destination from the Capital City of Tasmania is offered. Communication and Customer Service are foreign words to these amateur fabulosi. As quick as taking a glimpse over your shoulder, these fools will change the rules and leave you hanging without any means of transport! The score I give is only because I cannot give a negative rating: such a pity. Never again. I have a choice of three other airlines, and I will gladly share my hard earned dollars with them. "

The ticket itself cost 75, guess how that makes their customers feel. I do blame myself for not purchasing this myself beforehand, but I deeply regret choosing Tigerair now that I know this is ""how they get you"".

Impressed with the diversity of the cabin crew and they were smiling and efficient. For a budget airline departing late at night and arriving ahead of schedule, that was impressive. Decent value of money and I would say their level of service is superior to their Singapore counterparts."
A320,Solo Leisure,SYD to MEL,August 2016,4,5,4,4,yes,"""staff friendly and smiling""",Brian Lamprell,"✅ Verified Review | Flew SYD-MEL-SYD with Tigerair with mixed outcomes. The was the first time flying Tiger after a very unpleasant experience in 2005 in Singapore. For SYD-MEL while waiting in the boarding lounge a Tigerair staffer approached me asking if I’d like priority boarding and an exit row seat at no cost. Gratefully accepted, but 10 minutes before the scheduled departure, no aircraft had arrived. It was obvious we would be late departing. After boarding, we all sat like dummies to be told after a period that the flight would not be leaving for 45 minutes as we’d lost our place in the queue for take-off. The 0845 departure became 0940. Priority boarding is a waste under such circumstances. Inflight service was fine, and the staff friendly and smiling. The food and drinks are competitively priced. MEL-SYD began boarding at 1800 for an 1825 departure. Again, once boarded we were told that bad weather in Sydney had delayed arrivals and departures and we’d be held captive for an hour so Sydney air traffic could be sorted. It’s not Tigerair’s fault, but why were we boarded and why were we kept on the plane when we could have returned to the boarding lounge. Finally push back was 1905 and the uneventful flight landed in Sydney 30 minutes late at 2029. Again, the cabin crew were friendly, smiling and made very clear announcements."

Here is a tip, arrive on time and pack correctly and you will experience one of the best budget airlines flying at the moment. We flew Tiger to and from Denpasar (from Perth) and the total experience was faultless. The flight departed on time and arrived early at both destinations, the food was tasty, the staff fantastic and the plane spotless. I checked the departure and arrival times for the 10 days preceding my trip and it was all the same, depart on time and arrive on time. Many full fare airlines would welcome a standard like that. The total experience was perfect, well done to all at Tigerair Australia for how you have turned this airline around."

However, Tigerair Australia have other flights leaving on the same day running the same route and we have been told the next nearest flight is 2 days away. It took 40 minutes to get through to the call centre to be told Tigerair Australia are not running any more planes to compensate and will not cover hotel costs. I then asked about a refund which would take 3-4 weeks to process how utterly ridiculous!! They provided very little help and I have a strong feeling it has been cancelled due to something not relating to the weather. Even though this airline is cheap there is definitely a reason for it, they provide shocking customer service and definitely do not put their customers first. Do yourself a favour and avoid this airline at all costs before they ruin your travel plans and cause stress and wasted money."

Cheap flight, and more importantly an on time departure - somewhat of a novelty during the early evening Friday slot at Melbourne airport. Cabin service was friendly. Admittedly, the seats are packed in very tight. Although on a short flight such as this leg it's manageable. Little touches such as a wrapped serviette on a bottle of bubbles are nice. As are smiles from the crew. Return leg took off on time and arrived 10 min ahead of schedule. Excellent timing."
,Solo Leisure,BNE to SYD,May 2016,4,4,4,4,yes,"""flight was pleasantly surprising""",T Porter,"✅ Verified Review |  
I was very hesitant to fly Tigerair from Brisbane to Sydney, given its reputation as the budget of all budget airlines, and some not so good reviews in the past. On top of that, I am also a nervous flyer. However, this flight was pleasantly surprising. I happened to arrive at the airport very early and had problems working the check-in machines so a friendly Tigerair staff member checked in for me and then kindly offered to move me to a great exit-aisle seat. The plane itself was clean and comfortable - even nicer than the Jetstar flight I took on the outgoing flight. The flight was slightly delayed due to bad weather in Sydney (as were other flights) but otherwise very smooth and on time. Flight attendants also very friendly and helpful. The only annoying part is their carry-on baggage restrictions - everyone had to have their bag weighed before boarding to make sure they were under 7kg. I got through with 7.5kg but I heard someone having to pay $53 because they were over. So take this as a warning! Overall though, happy to do it again and recommend to others."

We get to Sydney airport ready for departure and waiting at gate 58 to board the flight as were waiting in line the Tiger staff start walking up the line weighing and measuring everyone's luggage - they measured my carry on bag, it being 2 inches over their length limit I was charged $83 to put my bag into the bottom of the plane. They may think it's a clever way to catch people off guard with no other option than to pay or leave your bag but they have lost a customer."

We got to Perth airport quite early (approx. 2.5 hours before check-in opened). The flight was departing at 2am, and the check-in was meant open at midnight - the desk and queue were already setup. We got in line at about 1150pm - there was a flight to Melbourne with Tigerair leaving earlier than our flight, and people were already checking in. After midnight passed there was a huge line behind us waiting to check in for Sydney - we started to get impatient and wondered what was going on. I went to ask at another Tigerair desk and staff told me that the check-in for Sydney was in the same line as the check-in for Melbourne. Nobody from Tigerair bothered to change the screen or come tell us, despite the fact we were all waiting in a hopeless line. We all transferred to the other line, which took forever. We were actually getting nervous about missing our flight. Only 2 people checking in 2 full flights. Once on the plane, our trip was great. The seat recline was good and I was able to get some sleep on the overnight flight. The flight attendants are personable and polite, and will assist you with anything you need. On landing, our bag was wet, but it had been raining so that's not really their fault. When checking in for Sydney to Perth, it was yet another check-in nightmare. We used the self-check-in to print off our tickets, thinking it would be faster, and I jumped in the short bag drop line. At this time, the check in for a flight to Melbourne was open as well, and because this flight left earlier they allowed Melbourne passengers to go first. No big deal but after the check-in for Melbourne was supposed to be closed, they still allowed people to cut in front of us, and we had been waiting patiently for close to 45 minutes. This was the only complaint I have. When on the flight, it was great like before."
,Family Leisure,ADL to SYD,March 2016,,,1,1,no,"""the check in was closed""",S Kuzmenkova,We arrived to Adelaide airport 44 min before our flight to Sydney with Tigerair to find out that the check in was closed (domestic check-in closes 45 minutes prior to departure). We went to Tigerair service desk to be told that the next available flight is 4 days from today and the staff were disrespectful. They were not interested at all to help. I asked to speak to a manager and was refused saying there nothing a manager would do. We booked the flight through one of the travel sites and did not see the fine print. The airline view was you booked through a travel agent so bad luck. This was the Ester weekend and everything was booked out. We ended up paying $2000 to get home to Sydney.

We left Sydney at 7am on Monday 21st March. On arriving in Melbourne I realized I had lost a ring. I reported this to the attendant and said that it was possibly in my bag as I had been getting things out of it on the flight. I asked her if she would check around my seat (2D) after the passengers had left the plane. When I was leaving Melbourne on Sunday I asked at the information desk and after checking, the attendant came back with my ring. The ring was very valuable and especially of sentimental value. I make regular flights from Sydney to Melbourne and back home with Tiger and will most certainly continue to do so in the future. Thank you once again. "

As it was the last flight of the evening, there was no ground staff or service desks open to assist me. It took me 4 phone calls the next morning to find someone who could assist me, (Tigerair said we don't deal with that bad luck). Finally the last phone call I was finally told my luggage was in Melbourne but couldn't have my suitcase delivered as I hadn't lodged a complaint the night before. I now have to drive 1.5 hours to pick it up. She then argued with me that there was staff there and that I didn't look. The only person there was security who pushed us out the door and said bad luck! Extremely disappointed in Tigerair service and Sydney airport.

They seem to offer a no frills, cheap service. The aircraft was modern and clean, cabin crew were nice, the leg room was decent in comparison to the low fare I paid. You can purchase food and drinks on board. Before boarding the plane, they do weigh your land luggage, and if it is over the allocated amount, they will charge you a fee at the gate (you can purchase extra baggage allowance online though).

My mate and I were heading up to the Sunshine Coast for a holiday, and discovered super-cheap airfares to Brisbane with Tigerair Australia. Once baggage fees and credit card fees were added, the return fare amounted to some $80 return (Qantas and Virgin usually charge $200 one way)! The flight to Brisbane on TT316 was immaculate. We both received exit row seats, and as we were in 1A/B we were also the first to disembark. The food available for purchase is about the same standard as other low-cost carrier, but real highlight was how attentive and friendly flight attendants were. This was the same on the return when we were offered exit row, and looked after with fantastic service. The return flights with Tiger at bargain basement prices topped off what was an amazing holiday to Noosa. If the price is right, I would definitely consider Tiger again. People must remember that this is a low-cost carrier, so they will have stricter rules regarding check-in times and baggage limits. But if you follow all instructions, you won't be bothered, and like us, you'll have an amazing flight!"

The girl at the check-in counter just stood there ""stone-faced"" and said that was the policy. We weren't even allowed to re-arrange our luggage. We had no choice but to pay. The plane was only partially filled so there was no weight problem. I tried to dispute it with Tigerair Australia and my credit card when we got home but was told we received the service.

(Don't check your bag) I booked a flight online from Sydney to Cairns with one checked in bag. Once I got to the airport they told me I had two checked in bags and no bags for the return trip. They said they couldn't do anything about it. At this point I experienced the non-customer service that Tigerair Australia is famous for. Be very careful when selecting baggage and double check once you have ticked off your return trip because it will change your first selection on baggage.  Never mind talking to any staff at the airport. They are very friendly but direct you to their website for any problems. The website is a joke, if you call the customer service number they tell you it's not their problem and direct you back to the website. If you try emails you will get a response only to say you have reached the wrong department and they direct you back to the website. I even asked to talk to a manager and was refused. No one at Tigerair Australia will take responsibility for anything. So remember if you check a bag with Tigerair you may have to leave it at your destination or pay again to bring it home with you as I did."

(They currently have the best ontime performance of all 4 main carriers in Australia.)  The aircraft are clean and tidy, seats are no better or worse than any other economy seat, and the cabin crew, whilst providing minimal interraction with passengers, are friendly. The only downside is that optional catering is expensive. Better to purchase food and beverages at the supermarket on the way. Also, staff at the boarding gates will enforce the rules rigidly - and will not negotiate. Passengers need to be aware of the rules of their airfare when flying with Tigerair in Australia.

The experience however was very smooth and for a low cost airline, I really cannot fault them. The staff were professional and helpful at every point, boarding was smooth, the flights departed and arrived on time and baggage collection was simple. They obviously have a very quick turn around at each airport, so seats etc aren't spotless, but not disgraceful either. There are definitely no frills to the service, but we didn't expect them either - we get what we pay for. I wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again if I was looking for a budget, straight forward flight."
A320,Couple Leisure,MEL to SYD,August 2015,3,2,1,1,no,Tigerair Australia customer review,J Stary,"We travelled MEL to SYD return last week and had the most appalling experience. Firstly, the access to Tigerair Terminal in Melbourne is long, no rails and wet and dirty surface. To navigate the narrow access takes at least 10 extra minutes, walking: no escalators, no moving path. This condition has lasted for the past 10 years we are told. And you always have to climb the steps to get to the plane, no connecting luxury. There was an unexplained delay with no apology, staff irritated when you ask the reason. The waiting rooms were overcrowded with three delayed flights customers, loud and littered with remnants of food and drinks. They would not return the ticket price if we decided not to wait.  We are senior citizens and had to face a 3 hour delayed flight from SYD to MEL. We asked the reason for delay, they asked for our boarding passes, took down numbers and gave them back. When the flight was boarding, our boarding passes were taken away from us and new ones issued. They had row 30 on them. We could not believe it. We were told by the young woman at boarding desk that those places are better than the row 15 we had paid for, as the boarding and exit are quicker. No amount of reasoning could move her. The plane was full, there was no question of redistribution of weight. Fortunately, the cabin staff were more understanding, and as our health condition is not ideal, we got back our original seats which were empty anyway. But the experience spoiled our flight which was otherwise quite smooth. "

We found the staff very unhelpful - in fact they had a deadpan face whilst giving us this news. There was no apology. There was no attempt to find another alternative route by the airline. I just found them really unsympathetic. I understand that they probably had to deal with many irate customers prior to telling me this new s- but this is just not good enough. We ended up cancelling our tickets and getting our tickets on credit and made plans with Jetstar.
A320,Solo Leisure,Brisbane to Adelaide,July 2015,4,5,4,5,yes,Tigerair Australia customer review,Stuart W Cole,"Brisbane to Adelaide on TT317 departed 4.50pm (local) arrived 6.50pm (local). Yes they police and enforce the carry-on limit but it works and allows for quick turnarounds. I took advantage of their new cabin+ which allowed me to bring on board up to 12kg. As I had pre-booked an exit row seat I had to counter check-in rather than use the self-serve kiosks but there was no waiting and quickly processed by friendly staff. At the gate, carry-on bags were being checked ad-hoc. Boarding was efficient and quick which allowed for an early departure. The aircraft was spotless and it was great to have cloth seats rather than the faux leather of Virgin. Yes its buy on board, but a good range of drinks and snacks were available. Very friendly cabin crew and great communication from the flight deck. It was actually the first time that I was asked if I needed assistance to place my bag in the overhead locker. Seat comfort no different to economy on Qantas, Virgin or Jetstar and in fact it seemed that the seats were wider than on the Qantas and Virgin 737's. Since being taken over by Virgin, Tiger certainly seemed to have improved and as long as you follow the rules concerning check in times and carry-on limits they provide quality safe air travel at quite reasonable prices when compared with Virgin and Qantas. You have to ask for the majority of flights in Australia under 3 hours, is the extra money to fly Qantas or Virgin for a complimentary muffin worth it. While Tiger only operate limited flights to/from Adelaide compared to Qantas and Virgin, I will certainly be happy to look at flying Tiger again if the price and flight times work."
A320,Business,Melbourne to Hobart,June 2015,4,5,1,5,yes,Tigerair Australia customer review,Alden K Cai,"MEL-HBA, turbulent flight and stressful because it was so cramped due to the need to put luggage in front-overheads space stolen! HBA-MEL flight much better. Tiger staff overall very friendly. Flights always good enough when there's not too many passengers. Comfort/assurance-wise nothing like Qantas, but for flights less than 2 hr Tiger is a very good option - best being the seat pitch is actually bigger than all other Aussie domestic flights."
,,MEL to SYD,,2,1,2,2,no,Tigerair Australia customer review,J Kim,Tigerair seems to be very strict on carry on luggage weight of 7kg per person. I flew from Melbourne to Sydney in end of May and the ground crew actually made some of the passengers to take off their coats in the winter to weight the coat on top of the luggage to make sure it won't pass 7kg limit. I know this is a budget airline but I find it hard to believe that we had to take off coats and sweaters in the cold weather so they can weight it. Very bad impression on Tigerair. My previous good experience with the airline is totally gone now.
,,Brisbane to Melbourne,,4,5,3,5,yes,Tigerair Australia customer review,M Horne,We flew BNE-MEL-BNE with an infant After reading all these reviews I was worried. No need to worry at all followed the rules was at the airport on time they did not weigh our cabin baggage they gave us an extra seat as the plane was not full. The staff were very kind to all parents with infants. Plane left and arrived on time both ways would fly them again.
,,Brisbane to Melbourne,,2,1,1,2,no,Tigerair Australia customer review,Christopher Konecny,Today (1/5/2015) I was boarding a flight from Brisbane to Melbourne. Everyone was kind and the service was good. However upon boarding the aircraft we were informed by the pilot that one of the engines was not starting. We were on the tarmac unable to move for 2 hours before the pilot told us was had to leave the aircraft and other arrangements would be made. After a 9 hour delay with nothing given to us but 'complementary water' we were finally put on another aircraft no help whatsoever from the crew to get a different earlier flight. The one thing I do applaud this terrible airline is the fact that they were able to spot the engine failure whilst still on the ground and not whilst we were mid-flight. I would never fly Tiger again and would never recommend it to anyone I know. They need to step up their game a routine 2 hour flight turned into an 11 hour ordeal.
,,Melbourne to Sydney,,1,2,1,1,no,Tigerair Australia customer review,Lalani Alim,"I traveled on Flight 218 from Melbourne to Sydney. The check in process went smoothly and the agent that assisted me was very friendly and that helped set the tone for a flight that was supposed to have been short and without incident. The flight was supposed to have been less than 90 minutes. I found out that Sydney Airport had closed due to inclement weather and that the fuel was low so the flight was diverted to Canberra. Absolutely no information was provided by the pilots or the cabin crew in Canberra as to when the flight would be back in the air or how long the ground delay would be for. I had told the cabin crew that I had to connect to an international flight and tried outlining steps that they could take such as requesting priority disembarkation/luggage collection and calling their ground reps in Sydney to see if assistance could be provided at the arrival gate for those that were traveling on connecting flights. Their response to me was ""we understand and we'll do everything we can to help"". After sitting in Canberra for well over 2 hours it became clear that I faced the very real possibility that I would miss my connecting flight. When the plane did land in Sydney I was left with a little over an hour to disembark run to baggage claim to get my luggage and transfer terminals in order to make my international connection. The flight did not arrive at a bridged gate. Instead passengers had to disembark by stairs and proceed up a single set of stairs into the concourse - I was sitting at the rear of the plane so you imagine what it's like walking behind more than a 100 other people because that's what happened to me. I was appalled upon getting to the concourse to find out that not a single Tigerair representative was around to meet the aircraft and offer help. In spite of me having clearly told the cabin crew that I was supposed to connect to an international flight and in spite of providing them with my departure time my luggage was one of the very last pieces to be removed from the plane. I then had to run to the train to the international terminal which I had to pay for and once there I ran straight for the Etihad Airways check in desk only to be told that the flight had already been closed and that it would not be possible to board. I had to watch the plane that was supposed to have brought me home push back and leave without me. I can understand that diversions and other unexpected circumstances can happen from time to time but after having been given the run-around after having been offered no legitimate help of any kind on the ground upon arrival in Sydney and after dealing with a flight crew that didn't have the least bit of sympathy for my situation and offered generic explanations instead of going out of their way to truly help me out I can assuredly say that I will never fly with Tigerair again!"
,,Sydney to Adelaide,,3,1,1,3,no,Tigerair Australia customer review,Anabelle Trinio,I travelled back from Sydney to Adelaide April 16 2015 with my hubby and 3 kids. I've got a High Functioning 15 yrs old son who was seated next to me and went to use the toilet in the middle of the flight (no turbulence that time) he normally does not want to use public toilets he came back to his seat and told me he had not used the toilet I said I would go with him and I waited outside. I was approach by a flight attendant who told me to use the other toilet at the back of the plane. I tried to explain to her that I was waiting for my son but in a loud voice she told me she wanted me to return to my seat. She did not give me a chance to say anything. I will never fly with Tigerair again.
