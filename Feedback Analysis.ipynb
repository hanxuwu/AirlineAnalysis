My wife and I recently flew TigerAir to Melbourne and on the way back home this airline had a staff member with portable scales weigh cabin bags of every single passenger lined up to board the plane. I was 1.4kg over (I had a bottle of water in my bag) and I was ordered to march over to the service desk and pay $36.45 for the extra weight. An expensive exercise for a few extra grams! We were terribly disappointed because we had prepaid for up to 25kg on the one luggage bag we checked in earlier, but it only weighed 19kg at the check in. If provision had been made to us to weigh our carry on bags at the check in, we would have had 6kg extra. Instead, we received a heavy penalty. This is pathetic and TigerAir ought to hang its head in shame for such unnecessary revenue raising tactics, lack of integrity and treating customers with little or no authenticity. If you are that poor, then please raise your prices, improve your level of Customer Service, which is currently extremely lacking to say the least, and needs a transfusuion of some sort. Stop treating people flying in your planes as illegal refugees! Your staff seem to be ill trained. I truly wish I had more positive comments to make - but I’m afraid this Tiger has no teeth. Good luck for the 'future'.\")\n",

After waiting in line for half an hour, we finally saw the plane touching down. It taxied around and then mate it to the gate. We started walking across the tarmac and the previous passengers we still getting off. The plane's interior is tight and looks bad. The seats are basically square and are very uncomfortable. The flight was only around 2 hours so it wasn't that bad. On flights, Tigerair does not provide any refreshments or meals. You can purchase them but they are pretty pricey. Tigerair does provide in-flight entertainment for a small amount. You have to download the Tigerair app before boarding the plane. Then you purchase the internet on the plane.
